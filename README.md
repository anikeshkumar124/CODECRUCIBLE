# Code Crucible

Welcome to Code Crucible, a modern online coding environment designed to help you practice and perfect your programming skills. This application provides an interactive platform where you can write, run, and test your code against a variety of classic coding challenges.

## Core Features

*   **Interactive Code Editor**: A clean and simple code editor for writing solutions in JavaScript, Python, and C++.
*   **AI-Powered Execution**: Instead of a traditional backend compiler, Code Crucible uses Google's Gemini AI to simulate code execution. This innovative approach allows for a flexible and scalable way to run code in multiple languages.
*   **Problem Solving**: A curated list of coding problems, ranging from easy to medium difficulty, to test your algorithmic thinking.
*   **Custom Test Cases**: Run your code with custom inputs to debug and test edge cases.
*   **Submission and Validation**: Submit your solution to run against a comprehensive suite of predefined test cases, just like a competitive programming platform.
*   **AI Code Quality Analysis**: After a successful submission, receive AI-powered feedback on your code's quality, with suggestions for improvement and best practices.
